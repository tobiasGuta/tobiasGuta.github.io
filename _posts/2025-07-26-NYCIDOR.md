You know how it is in New York everything moves fast, and you trust the system to just work. So, when I booked an appointment to get my NYCID, I didn’t think twice about handing over my info and waiting for that confirmation number.

But here’s the kicker: that confirmation number? It wasn’t just a ticket to my appointment. It was like a backstage pass to everyone else’s private info too.

No passwords. No security questions. Just a number that barely changed between bookings, letting anyone with a little curiosity and some patience peek into New Yorkers’ emails, phones, and full names.

This ain’t some Hollywood hacker drama. It’s real life. And it’s a reminder that even big-city systems can have some serious cracks.

In this post, I’ll break down how I stumbled on this flaw, why it’s a big deal for NYC residents, and how simple it would’ve been for someone with bad intentions to abuse it. Plus, I built a little demo app to show exactly how this kind of vulnerability works because understanding is the first step to fixing it.

## Recon

Honestly, I wasn’t even hunting for bugs at first. I just wanted to make an appointment to get a new NYCID. After booking, I received an email and SMS with my confirmation number. Nothing unusual.

A few days later, a family member needed to renew their NYCID, so I helped them book an appointment. When I got their confirmation number, I noticed it looked almost exactly like mine just one digit off. For example, mine was `10000000000` and theirs was `10000000001`.

  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

Curious, I decided to investigate further. I assumed there would be some kind of verification before accessing appointment details. The site asked for information like first name, last name, and phone number. There was also an option to enter an email address if you didn’t have a phone number.

  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

But then I saw another option: “OR confirmation number.” I entered my confirmation number and skipped the other fields. To my surprise, I was redirected straight to my appointment info full name, phone number, email, location, date, and time. No authentication. No extra checks.


Remembering the similarity in confirmation numbers, I tried changing the last digit. Sure enough, I could access someone else’s appointment details again, with no confirmation or security checks.

In bug bounty programs, you’re always asked: “What could an attacker do?” In this case, an attacker could brute-force the last digit of confirmation numbers and access other people’s personal information. This is a serious data breach risk, exposing names, emails, and phone number

## Real-World Example Scenario

Once you visit the appointment system, you see a page like this:

<img 
  src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*TehIWHbmMtZx-NygR5T7uA.png"
  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

Click "Book Appointment" and enter the details for user1:

  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

Normally, the confirmation code should be sent by email, but in this scenario, it appears directly on the next page:

<img 
  src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*UdpFia2b0fywaGy8aopiGA.png"
  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

With this code, you can go to "View / Reschedule / Cancel" to see your appointment details:

<img

  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

Now, book another appointment for user2 with their own information:

<img 
  src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*oNYDsgeAEpkfe_wdIMWD7w.png"
  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

User2 also receives a confirmation code:

<img 
  src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*FzxZl45nNu0OTAxsLMWxwA.png"
  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

They can view their appointment info the same way:

<img 
  src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*RYPl63lZKbtKFjgth9fadA.png"
  alt="No Detection"
  class="zoomable-img"
  style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 10px; cursor: zoom-in;"
/>

Here’s the vulnerability: anyone can guess or brute-force the last digit of a confirmation code and access other people's personal information (PII)

## Hypothesis:

Based on my experience using the NYCID system, I noticed that appointments are typically only opened every Friday for the following week. Given that pattern and the fact that confirmation numbers seem to increment predictably it’s possible that the system reuses confirmation numbers after each cycle.

If true, this could mean that older confirmation numbers may eventually point to new users’ data, making the risk even worse than initially thought.

Again, this is purely speculative and based on observed behavior I’m not claiming this as fact, but it’s an important possibility worth mentioning.
